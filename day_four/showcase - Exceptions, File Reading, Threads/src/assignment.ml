(* Side Effects *)

let (), () =
  let x = print_endline "foo" in
  (x, x)

let (), () =
  let x () = print_endline "foo" in
  (x (), x ())

(*
     1. What are side-effects? Give some examples.
     2. What are pure functions? What are their benefits?
     3. Why does delaying evaluation only make sense in case of side-effects or in presence of non-terminating expressions?
     4. Why do we want to use () instead of some unused variable or the discard _?
